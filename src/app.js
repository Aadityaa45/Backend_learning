/* Cookies are small pieces of data that a server sends to a user's browser. The browser stores them and sends them back with every future request to the same server.

Think of them like little notes the server gives to the browser:

"Hey, remember this for next time!" */



/*The cookie-parser is a middleware in Node.js (typically used with Express.js) that helps you read cookies sent by the client (usually the browser) in HTTP requests.

üîç What does it do?
When a client (like a browser) sends a request to your server, it may include cookies in the Cookie header. cookie-parser parses this header and makes the cookie data easily accessible in your app via req.cookies. */
