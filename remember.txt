Dekh Bhai yeh h bolkul professional setup of an nbackend project or i should say production based 

isme ek tool hota h "prettier" jo install karna  padta h usko mene abhi install nahi kara h par vo group me kaam karne me helpful hota h 

isme hamne nodemon sikha, basically nodemon jo hota h vo server automatically start karne ke kaam me aata h 

scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"
  },   something like this 


  fir sikha git ignore generator and role of git ignore

  ek bahut acchi baat pata chali ke empty files ko git push nahi akrne deta h until and unless usme kuch content likha na jae 


//lets talk about database connectivity here wew are using mongodb database as an practice purpose 

we have two ways to connect the backend with the database
1. we create a seperate file suck as "db" and write ghe conncetion code in it and call that code or file in our app.js and conncet from thwere
2. we write entire code of he conncection in the app.js itself 

dtabase se jab bhi kaam karo 
1. try catch ya promises lagao 
2. apna databse hameha dusre continent me rehta h to usko time to lagega hi isisliye async ka wait lagao 

JavaScript is single-threaded — it can do one thing at a time. If you perform time-consuming operations (like API calls, database queries, file reads), you don’t want the rest of your code to stop and wait.

This is where async/await helps!

It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code, making it easier to read and debug

every time we update .env file we have to restart the server
